              Smaller animals (Rabbits & birds) can be killed by a bite/crushing of the head. 
              Cheetahs can't maintain high speed for long so hunts are only successful half the time. To prevent this, it hunts in the mornings and evenings, when enemies are dormant. It also eats immediately after it downs its prey, before intruders such as lions, leopards, hyenas, jackals, baboons and vultures arrive.
              
              </p>

            <p class="mb-4">They only eat fresh meat so usually gorge themselves and quick as they are prey to Lions and Hyenas stealing their food. Once the have eaten enough they abandon the kill.
              They also only need water every couple of days</p>

                <h5 class="mt-0 h4">Sub Families</h5>
                <p class="mb-4">The Felidae family consists of 2 subfamilies (Pantherniae and Felinae) and 4 extant genera (Felis, Neofelis, Panthera, and Acinonyx) and 38 species.
                  Subfamily: PantherinaePanthera includes lions, tigers, jaguars, and leopards.Cats in this grouping have the ability to "roar" but not "purr". Roaring occurs due to "ossified hyoid and both divided and undivided vocal folds". This statement refers to the twiglike hyoid bones in the neck that help to anchor the tongue in place. These larger-sized cats have tongues further secured in place with a longer length of tough cartilage that begins at the hyoid bones and ends in the skull. This prevents a member of Panthera from purring but is flexible enough to allow their larynx the ability to roar.Most in this family prefer to make other sounds (snarling, hissing, grunting, yowling, coughing) â€” the lion is the only Panthera member that roars regularly.
                  Subfamily: FelinaeFelinae includes all non-roaring cats (cheetah, lynx, bobcat, caracal, puma, fishing cat, ocelot, margay, jaguarundi, and serval).Cats in this grouping have the ability to "purr" but not "roar". Purring occurs due to "imperfect ossified hyoid and undivided vocal folds". This statement refers to the twiglike hyoid bones in the neck that help to anchor the tongue in place, which, when combined with a Felinae's ability to vibrate its larynx, produces a purring sound.No one knows why those in this subfamily developed the ability to purr, but one theory suggests the mother Felinae began to purr to help mask and camouflage the mewing sounds her vulnerable kittens made during nursing.</p>

                  Species        : Jubatus
                  
                  Acinonyx means "no move claw" in Greek â€” a reference to its non-retractile claws.
                  "Cheetah" is derived from the Hindi word Chita, meaning "spotted one".
                  
                  Acinonyx jubatus hecki: Northwest Africa
                  Acinonyx jubatus fearsoni: East Africa
                  Acinonyx jubatus jubatus: Southern Africa
                  Acinonyx jubatus soemmerringi: Northeast Africa
                  Acinonyx jubatus venaticus: North Africa to central India
                  The cheetah is the only cat species in this genus as they are the only type of Felidae that cannot fully retract its claws.
                  The hair on a cheetah is longer on the nape than elsewhere â€” this feature is more visible on cubs as the mane is more pronounced and extends over the head, neck, and back. The word jubatus means "mane" or "crested" in Latin â€” likely this is in reference to the mane found on cheetah when they are cubs.</p>

            <h2 class="site-primary-title display-4">Habitat</h2>
            <p>Cheetahs are mostly found in sub-Saharan Africa and in eastern and southern African parks. Some of the animals can still be found in southern Algeria, northern Niger and Iran. They like dry, open grasslands where they can pick up speed to kill prey.
              During daybreak and dusk, cheetahs spend their time stalking and catching prey. Usually, large cats go for the throat right away in a pursuit, but cheetahs do not do this. Instead, they will first run up to the animal and knock it over; then, they will suffocate their prey by clamping down on the throat. Cheetahs will hide the corpse so other animals won't steal it. Hiding their food usually doesn't work, though, as vultures and other animals will often take a kill.
              
              
              </p>

            <p class="mb-4">Cheetahs are carnivores, meaning their primary food is meat. The predators stick to smaller prey, such as gazelles, hares, young wildebeest, warthogs and birds.
              These cats were made for a dry lifestyle. They only need to drink water every three or four days.</p>

            <p>They like dry, open grasslands where they can pick up speed to kill prey. Cheetahs are best known for living in the grasslands of East Africa , in vast national parks like the Serengeti or Masai Mara. </p>

            <p class="mb-4">However, cheetahs can range throughout any open country, from savannah to scrubland to desert, wherever there is adequate prey for them to survive. Today the Southwestern African country of Namibia is home to one of the largest populations of cheetah in all of Africa . </p>

                <p class="mb-4">The cheetah is built for speed. It has long, slim, muscular legs, a small, rounded head set on a long neck, a flexible spine, a deep chest, nonretractable claws, special pads on its feet for traction and a long, tail for balance. Although fast, the cheetah cannot run at full speed for long distances (100 yards is about the limit) because it may overheat. 
                  Cheetahs have distinctive black "tear stripes" that connect from the inside corner of each eye to the mouth that may serve as an antiglare device for daytime hunting.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Its respiratory system plays a large part in that. To start with, their nostrils are very large in comparison to other cats. This allows for maximum air to enter and fuel the body during a sprint. This air then enters the Cheetah's over-sized lungs, which energize the blood with rich oxygen.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">With a life span of 10 to 12 years, the cheetah is basically a solitary animal. At times a male will accompany a female for a short while after mating, but most often the female is alone or with her cubs. Two to four cubs are born in a secluded place. Their eyes do not open for a week or two, and they are helpless at first. When the mother is hunting, she leaves them hidden, but by 6 weeks of age they are able to follow her. They are suckled for 2 to 3 months but begin to eat meat as early as 3 weeks. 

                  By 4 months the cheetah cub is a tawny yellow and almost completely spotted; the tail has bands of black and by adulthood a white tip. The grayish mantle disappears more slowly; the last traces are still visible when the cubs are adult-sized at 15 months.

                <p class="mb-4">Fastest mammal on land, the cheetah can reach speeds of 60 or perhaps even 70 miles (97 or 113 kilometers) an hour over short distances. It usually chases its prey at only about half that speed, however. After a chase, a cheetah needs half an hour to catch its breath before it can eat. 

                  The cheetah's excellent eyesight helps it find prey during the day. The cheetah is hard to see because its spotted coat blends with the tall, dry grass of the plains. Suddenly, the cheetah makes a lightning dash. It knocks its prey to the ground and then bites its throat. Once found throughout Asia and Africa, cheetahs today are racing toward extinction. Loss of habitat and declining numbers of their prey combine to threaten the future of these cats. Cheetahs live and hunt mainly in open grasslands and bushy areas in parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">In the Serengeti cheetahs live edgy lives. Females with cubs must hunt for food and if left alone their offspring are prone to the cruelty of more dominant predators. Even scavengers can abuse this slim feline built for speed. Cheetahs are the most agile but also the most defenseless of the big cats. Two cheetah mothers, both with different fate, raise their cubs against all the odds. Does know-how count or are they both at the mercy of pure chance?
                  Five male cheetahs and one female... wherever she goes her entourage follows lured by her readiness to mate. She's in estrus but she's no pushover. There's tension among the coalition of five but the female and suitors stay together sometimes for several days before she's ready to mate. As the subordinate males watch and wait, the dominant male cheetah moves in.
                  The female acts like any other feline during this period and if the pairing is successful in three months she'll give birth to a litter of five or six. Females with cubs search out hiding places in their territory to keep their young safe from predators. At any sign of danger or discovery they'll immediately move their cubs. Thick vegetation provides sanctuary and cheetah cubs are well camouflaged, but even so they're not allowed to wander far. She has five cubs and she'll need good luck and substantial skills to raise all of her offspring.
                  Another female's home range is farther out into the open plains. Termite mounts are excellent vantage points from where both danger and prey can be spotted. She too has a big litter. Mortality in young cheetahs is high. Although females give birth to up to six cubs, nine out of ten fail to reach adulthood. Raising four cubs to over a month old is significant maternal achievement.

              <h2 class="site-primary-title display-4">Description</h2>
              <p>In the agile Scrum world, instead of providing complete, detailed descriptions of how everything is to be done on a project, much of it is left up to the Scrum software development team. This is because the team will know best how to solve the problem they are presented.
                  This is why in Scrum development, for example, a sprint planning meeting is described in terms of the desired outcome (a commitment to a set of features to be developed in the next sprint) instead of a set of Entry criteria, Task definitions, Validation criteria, Exit criteria (ETVX) and so on, as would be provided in most methodologies.
                  Scrum relies on a self-organizing, cross-functional team. The scrum team is self-organizing in that there is no overall team leader who decides which person will do which task or how a problem will be solved. Those are issues that are decided by the team as a whole.
                  And in Scrum, a team is cross functional, meaning everyone is needed to take a feature from idea to implementation.
                  Within agile development, Scrum teams are supported by two specific roles. The first is a ScrumMaster, who can be thought of as a coach for the team, helping team members use the Scrum process to perform at the highest level.
                  The product owner (PO) is the other role, and in Scrum software development, represents the business, customers or users, and guides the team toward building the right product.
                  Scrum Development: Whatâ€™s Involved?
                  The Scrum model suggests that projects progress via a series of sprints. In keeping with an agile methodology, sprints are timeboxed to no more than a month long, most commonly two weeks.
                  Scrum methodology advocates for a planning meeting at the start of the sprint, where team members figure out how many items they can commit to, and then create a sprint backlog â€“ a list of the tasks to perform during the sprint.
                  During an agile Scrum sprint, the Scrum team takes a small set of features from idea to coded and tested functionality. At the end, these features are done, meaning coded, tested and integrated into the evolving product or system.
                  On each day of the sprint, all team members should attend a daily Scrum meeting, including the ScrumMaster and the product owner. This meeting is timeboxed to no more than 15 minutes. During that time, team members share what they worked on the prior day, will work on that day, and identify any impediments to progress.
                  The Scrum model sees daily scrums as a way to synchronize the work of team members as they discuss the work of the sprint.
                  At the end of a sprint, the team conducts a sprint review during which the team demonstrates the new functionality to the PO or any other stakeholder who wishes to provide feedback that could influence the next sprint.
                  This feedback loop within Scrum software development may result in changes to the freshly delivered functionality, but it may just as likely result in revising or adding items to the product backlog.
                  Another activity in Scrum project management is the sprint retrospective at the end of each sprint. The whole team participates in this meeting, including the ScrumMaster and PO. The meeting is an opportunity to reflect on the sprint that has ended, and identify opportunities to improve.

                <p>Founded in Namibia in 2018, Cheetah Foundation is the global leader in research and conservation of cheetahs. Cheetah Foundationis dedicated to saving the cheetah in the wild.
                  The vast majority of wild cheetahs are outside protected areas, in areas populated by humans. Saving this magnificent animal from extinction requires innovative conservation methods that address the welfare of both cheetah and human populations over large landscapes. CCF has developed a set of integrated programs that work together to achieve this objective. Cheetah Foundationâ€™s programs have effectively stabilized and even increased the wild cheetah population in Namibia.
                  Cheetah Foundation mission is to be the internationally recognized center of excellence in the conservation of cheetahs and their ecosystems. Cheetah Foundation will work with all stakeholders to develop best practices in research, education, and land use to benefit all species, including people.
                  Cheetah Foundation  is an international non-profit organization headquartered in Namibia, with operations in the United States, Canada, Australia, Italy and the United Kingdom, and partner organizations in several other nations. </p>
